Systems</h1>
<h2 id="introduction"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>A supply chain management system helps an organization monitor and
optimize its production and distribution processes in order to increase
its efficiency. It connects all the processes involved in a supply chain
which includes planning, sourcing, making, delivering and returning.</p>

<p>Embedding an SCM system into your organization helps its operations
in a variety of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduced Cost</p></li>
<li><p>Customer Satisfaction</p></li>
<li><p>Better Quality</p></li>
<li><p>Increased Flexibility</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-functions-of-scm-systems"><strong><u>Key Functions of SCM
systems</u></strong></h2>
<p>They are mainly designed to control two functions in a supply
chain.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To monitor and control flow of goods: It helps in tracking raw
materials, work-in-progress and the end product from the beginning to
the end of the supply chain.</p></li>
<li><p>To monitor and control flow of information: It helps tracking
order statuses, inventory, demand and share this information.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To accomplish these functions there are different modules involved in
a SCM system which include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Logistics and Transportation: Logistics is the backbone of most
supply chain. Maintaining and optimizing this allows organizations to
reduce costs, optimize processes and improve customer
satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Inventory Management: This module is important in order to keep
track of your inventory and to ensure it is available wherever or
whenever it is required.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase order Management: This module provides a structured
framework in the procurement process. It standardizes orders and its
content. It helps validate order size, quantity, price, delivery dates
and terms and conditions. It also helps automating the purchase
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Warehouse Labor Management: This module helps in planning
warehouse labor and activities in order to maximize
productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Supply Chain Planning: It helps in effectively planning different
processes in the supply chain. Which can lead to saved costs, reduced
time and can even help anticipate or mitigate potential risks and
disruptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Procurement: This module helps minimize costs and helps make
better buying decisions. It helps in choosing the best suppliers thereby
improving supplier relations and reducing risks due to disruption in
supplies. It can manage a number of suppliers and even make
contingencies if there is a disruption in one of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Supply Chain Analytics: Analytics is an important part of any
organization in our time. It helps provide actual real time data and
insights which are crucial in any organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration: This module can help integrate different kinds
platform with the SCM systems. It ensures seamless dataflow between
different platforms with different solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Warehouse Management: This module helps manage and record serial
numbers of products, expiration dates and access real time inventory to
prevent stock outs and overstocks</p></li>
<li><p>Supplier Management: It helps organize different supplier details
and relationship management between them.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="role-of-ai-in-supply-chain-management-systems"><strong><u>Role
of AI in Supply Chain Management Systems</u></strong></h2>
<p>The main role of AI in SCM systems include</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Predictive Analytics: AI models can be used to analyze large data
sets to forecast future demands with great accuracy</p></li>
<li><p>Automation: AI can help automate a lot of tasks which earlier
used to take a lot of labor. Robots are used to automate processes in
warehouse which used to require forklift operators and manual sorting
can now be done with use of Robots and AI.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimization: AI can be used to optimize a lot of processes, a
variety of algorithms can be tailored to specific processes in order to
improve its efficiency</p></li>
<li><p>Analytics: AI can be used to analyze different data sets in order
to provide insights very quickly. It can identify risk and errors in
real time.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></h2>
<p>Supply Chain Management systems play a pivotal role in any
organization. It helps in increasing the efficiency of many processes.
It helps integrate all the different processes involved in a supply
chain into one system. It helps reduce costs, improve customer
satisfaction, Quality and Flexibility of different processes.</p>
<p>Different modules involved in an SCM system helps cover almost all
processes in a supply chain. It essentially controls the flow of goods
and information throughout the entire supply chain. With the Integration
of AI, information from this system can be analyzed and optimized
efficiently in order to forecast demands, automate tasks and get real
time insights about the data obtained from the system. Introducing an
SCM system into an organization has a lot of benefits which helps them
boost their overall efficiency and productivity.</p>
