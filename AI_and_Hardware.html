    <h1>The Silicon Squeeze 2.0</h1>
    <p>Why Building a PC in 2025 Feels Like Highway Robbery</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <p class="intro">The global PC hardware market is in crisis right now. Prices for components like RAM, motherboards, SSDs and GPUs have skyrocketed in the past few years due to the increasing demand for these components for AI applications</p>  
    <p>We are currently living through a hardware crisis that is being quietly subsidized by gamers and enthusiasts, a single massive force is distorting the entire market: <strong>The AI Gold Rush.</strong></p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591405351990-4726e331f141?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1000&q=80" alt="Close up of a complex computer motherboard">
        <p class="caption">It's not just a supply chain issue anymore. It's a priority issue. (Image: Unsplash)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Every time a factory converts a production line to make chips for an AI server,the average consumer pays the price.</p>

    <h2>1. The "AI Tax" on Memory is Real</h2>
    <p>The recent sky rocketting price of DDR5 memory is th recent example for this. Companies like samsung has been made fun of for refusing to sell DDR5 memory modules to their own companies. One of the leaders in this space micron has pulled out entirely from their consumer memory divison to cater to the AI companies. A lot of companies have started to prioritize the AI industry for profits leaving normal consumers empty handed.</p>

    <p>The introduction of DDR5 memory into the consumer market has allowed the AI companies to captalize the high bandwidth memory it provides and has begun sucking up the entire supply of it. It's faster, stackable, and vastly more profitable for manufacturers like Samsung and SK Hynix.</p>
    
    <p>So, what did they do? They converted their factories. They are literally ripping out the machines that make consumer DDR5 RAM to make room for AI memory production. The result? <strong>Artificial Scarcity.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Price Jump:</strong> In some regions, a standard 32GB kit of DDR5 has jumped 30-40% in price over just six months.</li>
        <li><strong>The Outlook:</strong> Analysts are predicting shortages well into 2026. If you see a good deal on RAM today, buy it. Seriously.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Motherboard Trap</h2>
    <p>The introduction of DDR5 ram has also increased the demand of motherboards with PCIe Gen5 lanes and support for high frequency memory has also increased. It has shifted the entire market upside down.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1000&q=80" alt="Detailed macro shot of electronic circuit traces">
        <p class="caption">Modern motherboards are incredibly complex to handle new speeds, driving costs through the roof.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It's not just corporate greed (well, maybe a little). It's physics. To support the insane speeds of PCIe Gen 5 and fast DDR5 memory, motherboards now need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>More PCB Layers:</strong> To prevent electrical interference.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Materials:</strong> Server-grade materials are now required for consumer boards.</li>
        <li><strong>Overbuilt VRMs:</strong> To handle power-hungry CPUs that boost to 6GHz.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The days of the reliable $100 B-series board are fading fast. You are now effectively forced to buy a server-grade motherboard just to play games.</p>

    <h2>3. The Storage Crisis: Enterprise Snatching</h2>
    <p>For a brief shining moment in 2023, SSDs were cheap. You could grab a 2TB NVMe drive for under $100. That window has slammed shut.</p>
    <p>AI models require <em>massive</em> amounts of fast storage for training data. Tech giants are buying up Enterprise SSDs (NAND Flash) by the boatload. Since there is a finite supply of NAND in the world, consumer drives are getting the leftovers—and the prices are creeping back up. The "Race to the Bottom" for storage prices is over; now it's a race to secure inventory.</p>

    <h2>4. The "Scalper Economy" is Still Here</h2>
    <p>The scalpers used to target GPUs during the crypto craze few years ago. They used to use bots for placing orders the moment a new GPU entered the market, destroying the chances for a normal consumer to even get one, now they just evolved. With high-end hardware becoming scarcer due to AI demand, automated buying bots are back in full force.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591799264318-7e6ef8ddb7ea?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1000&q=80" alt="Computer hardware components on a table">
        <p class="caption">Getting your hands on a high-end GPU at MSRP is still a battle against the bots.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The "AI Boom" has created a secondary market where high-VRAM cards (like the RTX 4090 or upcoming 50-series) are being snatched up not just by gamers, but by startup companies trying to build "homebrew" AI clusters. You aren't just competing with other gamers anymore; you're competing with venture-capital-backed startups.</p>
    <p>This has also created a new type modding where people are using VRAM modules from older GPUS and soldering them into PCBs of newer ones to leverage the better computational power from it, this enables them to run bigger AI models in it.</p>
    <div class="reality-check">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The fallout!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The cost of memeory has increased:</strong> The increased demand for DDR5 memory has increased it cost to a new peak. The same goes for high speed storage devices like SSDs.</li>
            <li><strong>The remergance of scalping and Modding:</strong> Scalpers who used to only target GPUs now target memmory kits, storage devices and motherbaords as well.</li>
            <li><strong>The Future:</strong> The AI squeeze is likely to increase the shortage of all kinds of computer hardware in the forseeable future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Building a PC in 2025 is likely to burn a hole in your pocket and it doesn't look like its gonna change anytime soon.</p>
