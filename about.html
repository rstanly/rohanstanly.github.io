    <h1>ðŸ‘¤ About Me</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Hi! Iâ€™m a student currently pursuing my MBA, with an undergrad in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I created this blog to share my assignments, projects, and learnings with others. </p>

  <p>My areas of interest include business analytics, operations, and supply chain. Iâ€™ve worked on projects like building a smart electric bike, and I hold a certification in digital marketing from Google.</p>

  <p>I hope this blog helps fellow students and showcases my journey in academics and professional growth.</p>
